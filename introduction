	} we use HLL such as C++
	} switch is made from transistors that's why only two options on and off 1 and 0 
	} machine language uses binary 
	} HLL-> assembly language ->machine language -> given to hardware
	} HLL to assembly code is done by compiler 
	} assembly code to object code is done by assembler 
	} object code to machine code is done by linker and then goes to hardware
	} Registers are used few are general purpose and few have special purpose.
	} Each register is 16 bit that is 2 bytes [general purpose registers]
	} Segment register: memory is divided in different segments eg some memory is save for only variables 
	} Control registers: such as flags which are 1 bit.
	} Data registers: there are total four of such registers names as AX, BX, CX, DX. Each is 2 bytes. These are also known as general purpose registers.
	} MOV == move syntax: MOV destination register, value 
	} Each register for eg AX can be further divided into AL and AH. Each has 8 bit separately.
	} It is comparatively easier to access data from register than memory.
	} MOV= move, ADD= add, CMP= compare


	Advantages of HLL
	} Program development is faster 
	} Maintenance is easier 
	} Programs are portable 
	
	Assembly language has one to one correspondence to machine language
	
	Advantages of Assembly Language
	} Accessibility to system hardware 
		○ Useful for implementing system software 
		○ Useful for small embedded system application 
	} Space and time efficiency 
		○ Tuning program performance 
		○ Writing compact code
