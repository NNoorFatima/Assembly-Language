MAIN CODE
Call proc_name
; leaves the current line and goes to the procedure and executes its instructions 
Macro_name
;just copies that line to main and executes then for example if L1 is defined in main and in macro then it will give redefinition error
;used only when a set of lines is repeated a number of times

Procedures are defined below main while macros are defined above main --general practice 
Procedures takes memory while macros donâ€™t
Can make nested macros and procedures
